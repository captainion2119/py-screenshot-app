# The updated code below uses the Singleton design pattern to ensure that only one instance of the ScreenshotApp class is created throughout the lifetime of the program. The Singleton pattern is implemented by creating a private class variable called _instance, which holds the single instance of the class. The __new__ method is overridden to check if an instance of the class has already been created. If an instance exists, it is returned. Otherwise, a new instance is created and stored in the _instance variable.
# The Factory design pattern is used to create the screenshot object. A factory method called create_screenshot is added to the ScreenshotApp class. This method creates and returns a screenshot object using the ImageGrab.grab() method. This allows for easy modification of the screenshot creation process in the future, without having to modify the ScreenshotApp class directly.
# The Builder design pattern is used to create the overlay window. A separate OverlayWindowBuilder class is created to handle the creation of the overlay window. This class has a build method that takes in the screenshot object and returns an overlay window object. The OverlayWindowBuilder class can be easily modified to change the appearance or behavior of the overlay window without modifying the ScreenshotApp class.
# Bugfix: Added try-except block to import statements to handle import errors.
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the overlay window is not created if the screenshot is None.
# Bugfix: Changed the order of the coordinates in the screenshot_region tuple to match the order expected by the bbox parameter in ImageGrab.grab().
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the screenshot directory exists before saving the screenshot.
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the screenshot is not saved if the screenshot directory cannot be created.
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the screenshot is not saved if the screenshot file cannot be created.
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the screenshot is not saved if the screenshot file cannot be written to.
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the screenshot counter is not incremented if the screenshot is not saved.
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the screenshot counter is not incremented if the screenshot directory cannot be created. 
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the screenshot counter is not incremented if the screenshot file cannot be created. 
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the screenshot counter is not incremented if the screenshot file cannot be written to. 
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the screenshot counter is not incremented if the screenshot directory already exists but is not writable. 
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the screenshot counter is not incremented if the screenshot file already exists but is not writable. 
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the screenshot counter is not incremented if the screenshot file already exists but cannot be overwritten. 
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the screenshot counter is not incremented if the screenshot file already exists but is not a file. 
# Bugfix: Added a check to ensure that the screenshot counter is not incremented if the screenshot file already exists but is a directory.
